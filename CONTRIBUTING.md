# Contributing

First off all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :muscle:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Series Rush.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Table Of Contents

* [Submission Process](#submission-process)
* [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)
* [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)
* [Styleguides](#styleguides)

### Submission Process

The following guidelines on the submission process are provided to help you be more effective when submitting code to the project.

The project's master branch is closed.
So, when development is complete (ideally on your forked repository), a patch set should be submitted via GitHub pull requests.
A review of the patch set will take place. When accepted, the patch set will be merged into the master branch.

Please submit all patches in public by opening a pull request.
Patches sent privately to any contributor will not be considered.
Because the project is an Open Source project, be prepared for feedback and criticism-it happens to everyone-.
If asked to rework your code, be persistent and resubmit after making changes.

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the [issues][1] as you might find out that you don't need to create one.
When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.
Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

**Note**: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing,
open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
